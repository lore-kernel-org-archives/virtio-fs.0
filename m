Hi Connor,

So as of now if a request is bigger than what virtqueue can support,
it never gets dispatched and caller waits infinitely? So this patch
will fix it by forcing fuse to split the request. That sounds good.

How did yo arrive at this overhead. Is it following.

- One sg element for fuse_in_header.
- One sg element for input arguments.
- One sg element for fuse_out_header.
- One sg element for output args.

Thanks
Vivek
