Please pay attention that unmap_mapping_range(mapping, ..., 1) is for the truncate case and friends

So as I understand the man page:
fallocate(FL_PUNCH_HOLE); means user is asking to get rid also of COW pages.
On the other way fallocate(FL_ZERO_RANGE) only the pmem portion is zeroed and COW (private pages) stays

Just saying I have not followed the above code path
(We should have an xfstest for this?)
