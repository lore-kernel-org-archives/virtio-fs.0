I'm not sure if I fully understand your idea. Then in this case, host
daemon only prepares 4KB while guest thinks that the whole DAX window
(e.g., 2MB) has been fully mapped. Then when guest really accesses the
remained part (2MB - 4KB), page fault is triggered, and now host daemon
is responsible for downloading the remained part?
