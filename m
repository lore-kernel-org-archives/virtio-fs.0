Agree. In retrospect it was my laziness in the dax-device
implementation to expect the block-device to be available.

It looks like fs_dax_get_by_bdev() is an intercept point where a
dax_device could be dynamically created to represent the subset range
indicated by the block-device partition. That would open up more
cleanup opportunities.
